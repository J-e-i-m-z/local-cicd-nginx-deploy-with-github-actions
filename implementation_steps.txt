1. Configure a Self-Hosted Runner on GitHub
   - GitHub-hosted runners (the default runners provided by GitHub):
   - VM must be accessible from the public internet to use github-hosted runners 
     because GitHub needs to SSH into the VM to deploy code
     but GitHub can’t reach something running only on a private/local machine.
   
   - Go to your repository on GitHub.
   - Click on Settings → Actions → Runners.
   - Click New self-hosted runner.
   - Choose Linux and x64 (if VM is Linux and 64-bit).
   - GitHub will give you these commands to run
     *Download commands
     *Configure commands
   - After configuring you may experience this error
     *The local machine's clock may be out of sync with the server time by more than five minutes.
      Please sync your clock with your domain or internet time and try again.
      ( This will prevent the runner from working properly )
      Fix the issue, inside your VM 
    
    - Last Step: Start the runner
      *./run.sh

2. Pipeline Development
   - Since we have set up your self-hosted runner on Vagrant VM,
     we no longer need to SSH or SCP into the VM from GitHub Actions. 
     Instead, GitHub will trigger the workflow directly on the VM where the runner is installed.
